description: 'They were four of the greatest minds in the Universe: Two men and two
  women, all Psionic Primes, lost in an experimental spaceship billions of parsecs
  from home. And as they mentally charted the cosmos to find their way back to Earth,
  their own loves and hates were as startling as the worlds they encountered ... Here
  is E. E. Smith''s classic science fiction novel -- one of the greatest space operas
  of all time!'
